# vimconfig
This is my Vim config file.

So for a new Mac, you're gonna have to do this for some reason...after you copy and pastte this into your .vimrc
<br />mkdir -p /home/$USERNAME/.vim/bundle
<br />Then go into this folder and clone the Vundle repo
<br />git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
<br />Then, run sudo vim
<br />Then :PluginInstall
